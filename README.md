# WeatherApp with Power BI & R
## Notice
This project is not fancy, it only for demo purpose.
## Introduction
### Method
This project use R to fetch data from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) API, and converting from JSON to the data that Power BI could read.
### Something else
Basically, it is a visualization of data but could update very easily. Some plot generated by R is used for learning and testing purposes.
## Usage
### In order to run this program, please follow this step:
* Make sure R is installed in local machine, and make sure 2 libraries are installed in local machine `jsonlite, ggplot2`.
* Open program "weather app.pbix", the default setting is the location at Milwaukee, US. The weather now page shows all parameters of current weather (time is UTC; current power bi cannot automatically handle local time zone).
* Refresh data by clicking `Home>Refresh`

### If you wish to change the cities of weather, please follow this step:
* Click `Home>Edit Queries`.
* Select one of the data set, then double-click `Query Settings>APPLIED STEPS>Souce` on the right panel; then find the line and change `city <- ""Milwaukee,US""` and `timezone <- -6`, the field of "Milwaukee,US" and "-6" to any city and time-zone as you like; however please follow the format of `<city name>,<country code>`, time-zone is the time shift over UTC. If you don't know your country code, you can type your city to [city](http://openweathermap.org/city) to check.
* Do this for another data set.
* Apply changes and close.

***Enjoy***
